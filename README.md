### Exercise: Linking and Navigation in Next.js

#### Goal:

The goal is to practice using Next.js's `<Link>` component for client-side navigation in a Next.js application.

#### Instructions:

1. Create two routes "dashboard" and "portfolio"

2. In the "home" page, create a simple landing page with a welcoming message and some content.

3. In the "dashboard" page, create a dashboard with various components, such as a navigation menu, user profile, and other related information.

4. In the "portfolio" page, create a dashboard with various components, such as a navigation menu, user profile, and other related information.

5. In the "dashboard" page, implement a navigation menu that includes links to the "home" page and other sections within the dashboard.

6. Use Next.js's `<Link>` component to create these navigation links. Ensure that clicking on these links navigates to the corresponding pages within the application without a full page refresh.
